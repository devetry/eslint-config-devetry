@devetry-eslint-config
======================

[Airbnb's eslint config](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb-base) provides a good starting point, but we don't always agree with their choices.

Rather than copy-pasting the same rules around different projects, we can now:

1. `npm install --save-dev @devetry/eslint-config`
2. Add `extends: "@devetry/eslint-config"` to your .eslintrc.

We will try to add reasons for our deviations from airbnb's base, where appropriate.
